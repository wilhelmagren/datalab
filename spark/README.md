# Apache Spark
##### Unified engine for large-scale data analytics

</div>


### What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science,
and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.


### Features

- **Batch/streaming data**
    - Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time
    streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.
- **SQL analytics**
    - Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting.
    Runs faster than most data warehouses.
- **Data science at scale**
    - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without
    having to resort to downsampling.
- **Machine learning**
    - Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale
    to fault-tolreant clusters of thousands of machines.


## Ecosystem
