##### Moving from PostgreSQL to MinIO + DuckDB

<br>

</div>


Migrating from PostgreSQL-heavy analytics to a MinIO + DuckDB architecture can dramatically improve performance,
reduce complexity, and lower costs - especially for large-scale analytical workloads.


## 1. Understand the current bottlenecks

Before migrating, assess:
- Which queries are slow and why?
- How large are the datasets (GBs, TBs)?
- What formats are the incoming files?
- How often is data updated or appended?


## 2. Adopt columnar formats in MinIO

DuckDB thrives on columnar formats like **.parquet**. If your incoming files are not already in parquet:
- Convert incoming CSN/JSON files to Parquet during ingestion.
- Store them in MinIO with a logical folder structure.

Use tools like Apache Arrow, Pandas, Polars, or DuckDB itself for conversion.


## 3. Replace ETL scripts with DuckDB pipelines

Instead of ingesting into PostgreSQL:
- Build DuckDB ETL scripts that read directly from MinIO using its S3-compatible API.

DuckDB can query remote parquet files directly - no need to mvoe data.


## 4. Build analytical workflows in DuckDB

Replace PostgreSQL-based analytics with DuckDB SQL:
- Analysts can use DuckDB locally or via Python/R notebooks.
- For large datasets, use DuckDB's external storage mode or query federation to avoid memory issues.
- Use DuckDB's built-in functions for joins, aggregations, window functions, etc.

DuckDB is optimized for OLAP-style queries and can outperform PostgreSQL by orders of magnitude.


## 5. Introduce a Metadata layer

To manage datasets:
- Apache Nessie
- Apache Iceberg
- DuckLake


## 6. Optimize storage and query performance

- Partition parquet files by time or category to speed up queries.
- Use ZSTD or Snappy compression.
- Precompute aggregates or materialized views in DuckDB for frequently accessed data.

## 7. Gradual migration strategy

- Start with a few datasets and replicate analytics in DuckDB.
- Benchmark performance vs PostgreSQL.
- Validate the results and get analyst buy-in.
- Decomission PostgreSQL ingestion once DuckDB proves reliable.


## Benefits of this architecture

| **Feature** | **PostgreSQL** | **DuckDB + MinIO** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Query speed | Slower for large data | Blazing fast with columnar format |
| Storage cost | High (DB storage) | Low (object storage) |
| Scalability | Limited by DB size | Scales with MinIO + DuckDB federation |
| Flexibility | Rigid schema | Schema-on-read, flexible ingestion |
| Analyst experience | SQL only (kind of) | SQL + Python/R + Notebooks |


## Performance tips

| **Tip** | **Benefit** |
|:--|:--|
| use parquet + compression | Faster reads, lower storage cost |
| Partition by time/category | Efficient filtering |
| Avoid `SELECT *` | Reduces I/O |
| Use DuckDB SQL functions | Fast aggregations and joins |
| External mode / streaming | Handles large datasets gracefully |


## Improvements

Using Apache Nessie as a catalog over MinIO where it acts as a versioned metadata catalog
(like `git` for data). It tracks tables, schemas, and branches across the data lake, integrates
with engines like Apache Iceberg and enables time travel, branching, and auditing of datasets.

DuckDB doesn't natively support Nessie, yet, but we can leverage it with Iceberg as a middle-man:
- MinIO <- stores parquet files
- Iceberg <- defines table metadata over parquet files
- Nessie <- tracks versions, schemas, branches
- Analysts <- query via DUckDB (read-only) or Spark/Flink (full)


## For the future: DuckLake

DuckLake is an integrated data lake and catalog format. It delivers advanced data lake features
without traditional lakehouse complexity by using parquet files and your own SQL database.

| **Aspect** | **MinIO + DuckLake** | **MinIO + Iceberg + Nessie + DuckDB** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Maturity | Early-stage (experimental) | Mature, production-ready |
| Complexity | Simple: DuckDB + MinIO | Complex: multiple sevices to deploy/manage |
| Versioning | Planned (git-like semantics) | Full support via Nessie |
| Schema evolution | Limited (early support) | Robust: add/drop columns, type changes |
| Time travel | Experimental | Supported via Iceberg snapshots |
| Branching | Conceptual | Supported via Nessie |
| Query engine | DuckDB-native | DuckDB (read-only) + Spark / Trino (full access) |
| Performance | Fast for DuckDB workloads | Fast + scalable with distributed engines |
| Integration | DuckDB only | Broad: Spark, Flink, Trino, Presto, etc. |
| Governance & audit | Minimal | Strong via Nessie |
| Community & ecosystem | Emerging | Large, active ecosystem |
| Use case fit | Ideal for small teams, fast iteration | Ideal for enterprise-grade data lake management |
